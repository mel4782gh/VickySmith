  <div id="Holistic Massage">
   <div class="subheading"><h3>Holistic massage</h3></div>
   <p>Holistic massage can be beneficial to many types of physical conditions and psychological problems.
   It uses various techniques to manipulate the body’s soft tissue and in particular the muscles.
   This flowing style of massage encourages relaxation whilst also incorporating some deeper work on areas of specific tension where necessary.
   The benefits of massage to the muscular system are an increase in blood flow and hence nutrients to the muscles, the breaking down and removing
   of waste products such as lactic acid from the muscles,
   an improvement in tone and elasticity and the loosening of adhesions and thickenings which may have
   resulted from injury or misuse. These beneficial effects can result in improved posture and
   flexibility and a reduction in muscular spasm. This can bring pain relief and a faster recovery
   from muscular injuries as well as prevent injuries and some of the potential long term detrimental
   effects of poor postural alignment such as arthritis.</p>

   <p>The deeply relaxing effects of massage can help to prevent the onset of stress related conditions
   by activating the parasympathetic nervous system which encourages ‘rest and digest’ as opposed to
   the ‘fight and flight’ response to stress. This in turn can have numerous beneficial effects such
   as more efficient breathing, improved digestion, improved immunity, decreased blood pressure,
   increased energy levels, improved mood and a general feeling of well-being.</p>
</div>

  <div id="Aromatherapy">
    <div class="subheading"><h3>Aromatherapy</h3></div>
  <p>Aromatherapy is the use of aromatic essential oils for physical and psychological well-being.
    These essential oils are extracted from natural sources such as plants, flowers and trees.
    The psychological and emotional benefits of Aromatherapy occur primarily due to the Aroma
    that essential oils produce. This is as these Aromas are known to have an effect on out
   limbic system which is the part of the brain that controls our mood, emotions, memory and learning.
  The physical benefits of Aromatherapy occur primarily due to the chemical compounds that
  different essential oils contain. These are known to have a variety of properties such
  as anti-bacterial, anti-septic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-spasmodic,
   expectorant, diuretic, wound healing and vasodilatory (improves circulation).</p>
<p>An Aromatherapy blend contains a mixture of essential oils in varying quantities that is
  tailored to the individual depending on what someone would like to achieve from the treatment.
  The oils in the blend enter someone’s system through their skin during an Aromatherapy massage
  whereby they can help to improve numerous conditions such as allergies, skin conditions,
  digestive disorders, hormonal imbalances, respiratory conditions, poor circulation,
  fluid retention, headaches and migraines. They can also be emotionally uplifting, soothing,
  relaxing, energizing or stimulating helping with stress, anxiety, low mood, fatigue and insomnia.
  Aromatherapy can therefore be a very effective treatment as someone benefits from both the
  effects of the massage itself as well as the essential oils used. Aromatherapy massage is
  traditionally a gentle and very relaxing style of massage which uses pressure points to
  aid the absorption of essential oils. However, the style of massage can be adapted to
  suit the individual. For instance, someone could receive a Sports massage that is carried
  out with an Aromatherapy blend that is of particular benefit to the muscular system.</p>
</div>

  <div id="Sports Massage">
    <div class="subheading"><h3>Sports massage</h3></div>
  <p>Sports massage uses many of the same techniques as other forms of massage with the addition of
    other techniques that are useful in preventing and treating injuries. It therefore has many of
    the same benefits as other forms of massage but has a more in depth focus on any areas that
    may be problematic and can therefore result in some temporary discomfort as it reaches the
    deeper layers of muscles as well as the superficial. Sports massage also tends to involve
    more active participation of the client for instance during stretches.</p>
    <p>When used during training Sports massage aims to improve the suppleness, flexibility
      and strength of muscles and encourages good posture making tissue less prone to injury.
      It helps with the removal of lactic acid so that recovery time is reduced enabling
      someone to train more intensely and for longer without muscle soreness, weakness
      and stiffness which ultimately increases performance potential. It also speeds up
      the healing of tissue that has already been damaged by improving circulation,
      reducing pain and encouraging any resulting scar tissue to be laid down in a
      healthier alignment which is stronger and suppler.
   Due to the Remedial nature of Sports massage it can also be very beneficial for
   people who experience consistent pain, are involved in repetitive and strenuous
   physical activity and whom have musculo-skeletal imbalances and injuries.

  <div id="Reflexology">
  <div class="subheading"><h3>Reflexology</h3></div>
  <p>Reflexology is based on the theory that different points on the feet are connected
  to different parts of the body via energy pathways. A Reflexologist stimulates
  these pressure points known as reflexes using specific massage techniques which
  can help to clear the related energy and nerve pathways.</p>
  <p>Reflexologists take a holistic approach to health which aims to treat the whole person
and not just the prevailing symptoms. During a Reflexology treatment the Reflexologist
will work on the reflexes for all of the systems of the body with the aim of helping
the entire body to function more efficiently and in a balanced way. This enables the
body to deal with stress better and as Reflexology is by its very nature a relaxing
treatment helps to prevent the onset of stress related conditions. This relaxed state
can also encourage the body to heal itself naturally.</p>
<p>Reflexology can therefore be helpful to many conditions with numerous benefits which
can include a feeling of well-being, improved circulation, more efficient breathing,
improved immunity, elimination of toxins, increased energy levels, improved neural
efficiency, balancing of the nervous system, balancing of the hormonal system,
improved digestion, improved mood and pain relief. People also tend to sleep particularly
well following  a treatment.</p>

  <div id="Indian Head Massage">
    <div class="subheading"><h3>Indian Head massage</h3></div>
  <p>Indian Head Massage has played an integral part of the daily routine in India for
  1000s of years. The Indian Head Massage techniques practiced today in the West are
  based on these techniques but have been adapted to include the neck, upper back,
  shoulders and arms which are the areas of the body considered to be vulnerable to stress.
  The techniques used today are therefore more of a stress management treatment which often
  leaves people with renewed energy to tackle the pressures of daily life.</p>
  <p>An Indian Head Massage is carried out through clothes with the receiver in a sitting position.
Indian Head Massage can be carried out with or without the use of oils on the scalp depending
on the receiver’s preference.</p>
 <p>The benefits of Indian Head Massage include many of the general benefits of Swedish massage
such as relief from aches and pains, improved posture, improved circulation, more efficient
breathing, detoxification, improved immunity, increased energy levels, improved mood and a
feeling of well-being. In addition Indian Head Massage helps to promote clearer thinking,
promotes hair growth, helps to relieve tension headaches, eye-strain and sinus issues and
helps to prevent migraines and insomnia.</p>
